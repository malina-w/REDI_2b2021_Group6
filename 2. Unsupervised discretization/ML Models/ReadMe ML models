For each dataset (iris, pendigits, satimage), we perform:
(1) Classification Algorithms
- 3 classfication algorithms: Categorical Naive Bayes, Decision tree ID3, and KNN (with customized distance metric - VDM)
- 10 discretized datasets
=> Total models generated for each dataset: 30 models

(2) Model metrics:
- Accuracy
- F1 score
- Classficatin bias
- Classifcation variance
